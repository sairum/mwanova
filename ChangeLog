31-7-2003 Version 2.0.2

Another anoying and hidden bug fixed. This prevented good designs with
two orthogonal factors nested into another one to be computed. The problem
was only revealed when the nested factor with the highest number of levels 
was entered in a column before the other nested factor and not the other
way...

7-6-2001 Version 2.0.1

A "hidden" bug was found! This affected seriously the final results
but only if the data included a nested factor with more than 10 levels
and observations were entered in an unordered way. Ordered datasets
were immune to the bug. The  problem was in the algorithm used to
orthogonalize the data. A new algorithm, with recursive functions
(which I was avoiding) seems to be working properly with any type of
datasets.

Another minor bug was found in the functions which compute the
Cornfield-Tukey rules. In some very particular cases (complex mixed models) some terms had no tests when, in fact, there were tests for them. 

24-5-2001 Version 2.0

SNK tests added. Homogeneity tests now include exact probabilities
thanks to Igor Baskir who has provided a way to compute Cochran's C
probabilities. F and Chi-square probabilities do not depend anymore
on external libraries. The code to compute such probabilities was
grabbed from CCMATH, developed by Daniel A. Atkinson to whom I also
want to thank.

29-3-2001 Version 2.0-pre1

Complete rewrite of code. Most things are now handled dynamically.
Multiple comparison tests included. Handling of missing data included.
Input files now contain all information about the model... no more
model files.

19-6-1999 Version 1.1

Fixed a bug in means.cpp which prevented mwanova from computing
means tables for more than 5 factors!

Fixed a small bug in CT Rules related with mixed models. For some mixed
models, where a factor was nested in another but orthogonal to a third
one, mwanova produced a correct CT Table but displayed non-testable
F ratios when there was, in fact, a test.

Fixed a small problem in Makefile related with the absence of libprob

20-1-1999 Version 1.0

Option -a now produces a table that also includes variance estimates
for each average.

Option -a now produces some Homosdeascity tests but no probabilities, because
there are no Hartley's Fmax, Cochran's C, etc probs in the net.
